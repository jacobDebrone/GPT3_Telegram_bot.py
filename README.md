free chatgpt telegram bot
Overview

This Python script implements a chatbot using the Telebot library for Telegram and the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model for natural language processing. The chatbot engages in conversations with users, processing their input and generating responses through a free chatgpt API.
Features

    Handles user messages and maintains conversation history for each user.
    Sends system messages to users introducing the chatbot's persona (Debrone).
    Utilizes the OpenAIAPI class to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model for response generation.
    Handles errors and connection issues gracefully with the reconnect_and_handle_errors function.

How to Use

    Replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with your actual Telegram bot token obtained from BotFather.
    Ensure the required libraries (telebot, requests, json, time, and traceback) are installed.
    Run the script.
